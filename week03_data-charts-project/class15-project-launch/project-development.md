# Project Development

## Outcome First

1. Focus on static HTML (plus layout CSS) Representation _first_.
1. Then bring in dynamic data, events, etc.

## Known Good State

1. Keep in clean!
1. Incrementalism
1. Not a goal to obtain, but a place to never leave

## Example Deployment

* [Template Project](https://github.com/alchemy-bootcamp-one-summer-2018/template-project)
* Correct issue with import of `html.js`
