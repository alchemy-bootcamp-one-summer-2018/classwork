# Project Definition

If you need ideas, look over the list of projects in Canvas. 

## Selection

As a group, choose one that appeals to you. Make sure all voices are heard. If you like to talk, make sure to listen. If you are quiet, time to speak up and by heard.

## Project Pitch

Use a whiteboard to collaboratively write out the following:

- Your project topic
- Your project pitch:
  - What is the problem you're solving?
  - What will be your solution to the problem?
  - What are the benefits to your solution?

## Review with the Instructional Team

Once you have the above things done, find Marty or one of the TAs and present your project pitch and group agreement. This is so we can make sure you're on track and not biting off an impossible project.

## User Stories

After you've met with someone from the instructional team, it's time to start crafting some user stories. Add your user stories to a `user-stories.md` file in your repo. Remember, user stories give:

- the backstory of a particular user
- the context in which they'll be using your app
- why they will use your app
- what knowledge/previous experience (or lack thereof) they come to your app with

Focus on application value, should not have any technical design or tasks

Better to a few well-crafted meaningful user stories than a volume of ill-defined, vague ideas.
